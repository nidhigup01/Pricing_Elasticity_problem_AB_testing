Selecting Control Variables
Some ideas for control variables for the spa example are:

Average sales per store per month. Since we have transaction line item data, we could aggregate the data by invoice, then average by month and store to get the average sales amount per store per month.
We could use the average number of invoices per month per store as a control variable.
Using the SKU Category information, we could calculate the average number of facials and the average sales for facials per month.
Remember the Problem Solving Framework? You may have to try different combinations to find variable that give you the best matching results. If you're not familiar with the Problem Solving Framework, you are encouraged to take the Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics to help you think through a business problem.
